# Installation

The build dependencies are the same as for srsLTE and can be found [here](https://github.com/srsLTE/srsLTE#build-instructions).

### Download and build:
```
git clone https://github.com/FabianEckermann/cv2x-traffic-generator.git
cd cv2x-traffic-generator
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

### Install:
```
sudo make install
```


# Usage

The traffic generator can be used with static settings
```
   cv2x_traffic_generator -a clock=gpsdo -s 0 -l 5
```
or with a configuration file (an example config file is included in this repository)
```
   cv2x_traffic_generator -a clock=gpsdo -i sf_config.csv -o logfile.csv
```
